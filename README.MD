# Capy Game

## Anthony's Prototyping branch

The branch is where I will test out, clean up, and prototype new level design features before implementing them onto main

## TODOS:

1. Make player leap away from enemies when colliding with them
2. Make player and enemies loose health when colliding with them.
3. Make enemies osolate
